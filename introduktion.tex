This report adresses why the currently used scrambling standard CSA 
needs a replacement. Proposed replacements to CSA are analyzed to some 
extent, and an alternative replacement (AES128) is analyzed.

One alternative being the CSA3, and the other being the CISSA algorithm.
Both of them are based on the public AES algorithm. Both of the 
proposed algorithms use the AES algorithm as a base. The CSA3 combines 
it with a secret cipher, the XRC, while CISSA uses the AES cipher in a 
feedback mode. The different utilizations makes CSA3 hardware friendly 
and CISSA software friendly.

The implementation of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is 
analyzed for a 128 bit key length based design, and the general 
implementation is displayed.
