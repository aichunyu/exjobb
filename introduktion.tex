This report adresses why the currently used scrambling standard CSA 
needs a replacement. Proposed replacements to CSA are analyzed to some 
extent, and an alternative replacement (AES128) is analyzed.

One alternative being the CSA3, and the other being the CISSA 
algorithm. Both of the proposed algorithms use the AES algorithm as a 
base. The CSA3 combines AES128 with a secret cipher, the XRC, while 
CISSA uses the AES cipher in a feedback mode. The different 
utilizations makes CSA3 hardware friendly and CISSA software friendly.

The implementation of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is 
analyzed for a 128 bit key length based design, and a specific 
implementation is presented.
