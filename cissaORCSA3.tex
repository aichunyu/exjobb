\chapter{CISSA and CSA3}
There are currently two scrambling algorithms being assessed as 
replacements to the currently used DVB-CSA. This is done to assure 
content security for yet another ten years.

CISSA is meant to be a hardware-friendly as well as software-friendly 
algorithm designed to allow descrambling to be made on CPU-based units 
such as computers, smart phones and tablets \citep[p. 9]{DVB:2013}.

CSA3 is a hardware-friendly, software-unfriendly scrambling algorithm 
chosen by the ETSI to replace the currently used CSA 
\citep[pp. 6--7]{DVB:2013}. Software-unfriendly means that 
descrambling is designed so that it is highly impractical to perform 
in software, but easily done in hardware.

Both of the algorithms are to be implemented in hardware for 
scrambling of data. The difference is that CSA3 is to make it hard to 
descramble the material, using software. Since both of the algorithms 
are confidential, it is sadly impossible to find out what makes the 
CSA3 algorithm software-unfriendly, while the CISSA algorithm is 
software-friendly.

\section{CISSA}
CISSA stands for \emph{Common IPTV Software-oriented Scrambling 
Algorithm} and is designed to be software-friendly. Opposite to the 
CSA3, CISSA is made to be easily descrambled in software, so that 
CPU-based systems such as computers and smart-phones can also 
implement it.  Although it is software-friendly, it is supposed to 
able to be implemented efficiently on hardware as well as in software 
\citep[p. 9]{DVB:2013}.

CISSA is to use the AES-128 block cipher in CBC-mode with a 16 byte 
IV with the value 0x445642544d4350544145534349535341. Each TS packet 
is to be processed independently of other TS packets, but each block 
of data in the payload depends on the previous blocks of data in the 
same payload, except the first block of data, which depends on the IV. 
Both the header and adaptation field are to be left unscrambled. \citep[p. 11]{DVB:2013}

\subsection{Software friendly}
An FPGA implementation of the CISSA algorithm seems likely to be 
implementable, due to the fact that the scrambling of the content is 
supposed to be made in hardware, regardless as to whether the 
descrambling is supposed to be made either in hardware or software.

While having a scrambling algorithm designed to enable viewing on 
CPU-based units opens up the market for more users, it might increase 
the risk for algorithm theft. Since reverse-engineering is possible 
for software implementations, one might find the algorithm for 
descrambling, as well as scrambling through inversion of the algorithm.
Knowing the algorithm enables cryptoanalysists to search for 
weaknesses in the algorithm, with the purpose of breaking it.

"A cryptosystem should be secure even if everything about the system, 
except the key, is public knowledge." according to Kerckhoffs's 
Principle.

This means that the only result of having a descrambling method suited 
for hardware as well as software implementation should possibly only 
result in some free implementations showing up. But it being 
implemented in software should therefore not lead to any problem.

%Is this even a problem? I think WISI utilizes a free implementation of the CSA.

\section{CSA3}
The CSA3 scrambling algorithm is based on a combination of an AES 
(\emph{Advanced Encryption Standard}) block cipher using a 128-bit 
key, which is simply called the AES-128, and a confidential block 
cipher called the XRC \citep[p. 8]{DVB:2013}. XRC stands for eXtended 
emulation Resistant Cipher and is a confidential cipher used in DVB 
\citep[p. 8]{DVB:2013}.

\subsection{Hardware friendly}
The CSA3 is designed to be hardware-friendly, meaning that 
descrambling through software methods is supposed to be next to 
impossible. Using a software-hostile descrambling algorithm means that 
reverse-engineering and algorithm theft becomes hard, if even possible.
Even though it would decrease the probability of content theft, it 
closes the door to expansion onto the CPU-based units market, which is 
becoming larger and larger.

\section{Conclusion}
CSA3 implements the AES-128 cipher for scrambling, combined with a 
confidential cipher, called the XRC cipher. CISSA does not, on the 
other hand, seem to be using any confidential cipher. It does however 
use the AES-128 cipher in CBC-mode with a static IV \citep{DVB:2013}.

CISSA sounds like a great idea, since it would allow CPU-based units 
to descramble data streams without using a dedicated HW-Chip. Regardless
of which cipher is the best, or will prove to become the next standard, 
both of them use AES-128 as a building block. Therefore, starting out 
with an AES-128 chiper would provide for a basis to continue developing 
the scrambler towards either CISSA or CSA3 on a later stage. Due to the
CIplus interface being implemented, software descrambling and theft will
very likely not be as big of a problem using a software friendly 
scrambling method. AES-128 in CBC-mode seems to be the best to 
implement, since it is mandatory for HD hosts using the CI+ interface 
\citep[p. 15]{CI+:2011}.
