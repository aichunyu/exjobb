\chapter*{Layout of the circuit} \label{app:blocks}
This purpose of this chapter is to give an overview of what the circuit is 
supposed to look like, realized using blocks. The top entity is the 
aes\_scrambler (Figure \ref{block:scrambler}). Note that the manager-entity in Figure \ref{block:scrambler} and 
\ref{block:round} are not the same entities.
