\chapter{Advanced Encryption Standard}\label{ch:AES}
The AES is based on an SP-network and is fast both in hardware as well 
as software. Rijndael, which is used in AES, has key-sizes of at least 
128 bits, block lengths of 128 bits, 8 to 8 bit S-boxes and a minimum 
of 10 rounds of repetition \citep[p. 79]{Stinson:2006}. It is a 
symmetric-key algorithm with a fixed block size of 128 bits, where the 
key-size can vary between 128, 192 or 256 bits. The number of cycles 
needed to convert the plaintext into ciphertext depends on the size of 
the key. The 128-bit key requires 10 cycles of repetitions (rounds). 
The 192-bit key requires 12 rounds and the 256-bit key requires 14 
rounds \citep[p. 103]{Stinson:2006}.

\section{Method}
The AES consists of a number of steps that are repeated for each block 
to be encoded. The steps to be performed are, according to 
\citet{Stinson:2006}:

\emph{Set-up steps}
\begin{enumerate}
\item KeyExpansion - Produce round keys.
\item InitialRound - Combine each byte of the state with a byte of 
  round key.
\end{enumerate}
\emph{Steps performed in rounds}
\begin{enumerate}
\item SubBytes - Each byte is \emph{substituted} using the Rijndael's 
  S-box.
\item ShiftRows - The rows of the state matrix are \emph{permutated}.
\item MixColums - The columns of the matrix are multiplicated with a 
  matrix.
\item AddRoundKey - The state matrix is once again combined with 
  round-keys.
\end{enumerate}
\emph{In the final round everything except the MixColumns step are done}
\begin{enumerate}
\item SubBytes
\item ShiftRows
\item AddRoundKey
\end{enumerate}

The ciphertext is then defined as the state-matrix 
\citep[p. 103]{Stinson:2006}. As mentioned in section 
\ref{ch:ConfDiff} (\nameref{ch:ConfDiff}), both confusion and diffusion 
are nescessary. They can be seen in the SubBytes and ShiftRows steps 
above. These steps also performs whitening, which strengthens the 
cipher. Whitening is, as mentioned in \ref{ch:ConfDiff}, performed 
through an XOR between the roundkey and the data.

The KeySchedule is explained in section \ref{sec:KeySch}.

\subsection{InitialRound}
This is simply an initial AddRoundKey.

\subsection{SubBytes}
In the SubBytes step, each byte is sent to a Rijndael S-box (which is 
basically a lookup table, see Matrix \ref{matrix:rijSbox}) where they 
are substituted in a non-linear fashion. This gives us a substituted 
state matrix.

\subsection{ShiftRows}
The next step is called the ShiftRows step, which left-shift the rows 
n-1 steps where n is the index of the row. This means that the first 
row is left as it is, the second row is shifted one step, the third row 
is shifted two steps, and the fourth row is shifted three steps.

\subsection{MixColumns}
In the MixColumns step, the four bytes of each row are combined through 
a matrix multiplication. The MixColumns function takes four bytes as 
input and multiplies them with a fixed matrix (figure 
\ref{matrix:rijMix} in appendix \ref{app:matrix}). While this might 
seem simple, it really is not. The multiplication makes sure that each 
input byte affect all output bytes.\citep{Angelfire}

The matrix is multiplicated with the vector from the left, (4x4*4x1 = 
4x\hcancel{4*4x}1 = 4x1) where the vector is a column from the 
state-matrix. Multiplication with 1 means that the value is left 
untouched. Multiplication by 2 means left shift, then an XOR with 0x1B 
if the shifted value exceeds 0xFF. Multiplication with 3 is done in the 
same way as a multiplication with 2, except that the result after the 
shift and conditional XOR are then XOR:ed with the input value of the 
multiplication. All of the resulting values are then XOR:ed, leaving us 
with the result. All additions are replaced with XOR, since the 
calculations take place in GF(\(2^8\)) (Galois field).

\subsection{AddRoundKey}
Each of the 16 bytes of the state are then combined with a byte from 
the round key using a bitwise xor. They are then combined to a state 
matrix (figure \ref{matrix:state} in appendix \ref{app:matrix}) 
containing 4x4 bytes.

\section{KeyExpansion}\label{sec:KeySch}
To generate round keys from the cipher key, the Rijndael's key schedule
is used. This is done since AES requires a separate 128-bit (16-byte) 
round key for each round, plus one extra key for the initialization 
which means that the AES-128 requires 176 bytes, since AES-128 consists 
of 10 rounds.

The schedule consists of a couple of loops and a key-schedule core. The 
schedule core is the part that branches out if c modulo 16 is zero. 
The entire KeyExpansion can be viewed in Figure \ref{img:keysch} in 
appendix \ref{app:fig}. To change the key schedule to fit a key size of 
192 bits, you simply change the value c is compared to in the first 
branch in the flowchart from 176 to 206.

\subsection{Key-schedule core}\label{sec:kCore}
The key-schedule core takes an input of 4 bytes (32 bits) which it then 
rotates 1 byte (8 bits) to the left. Let us say that our key is 
\emph{AB CD EF 01}. This would give us the key \emph{CD EF 01 AB} after 
the rotation. This operation is also called the RotWord-operation 
\citep[p. 107]{Stinson:2006}. The next step is to apply Rijndael's 
S-box to each of these bytes, giving us 4 new bytes. The bytes 
{AB CD EF 01} would give us {62 BD DF 7C}, when substituted according 
to the Rijndael S-box (Figure \ref{matrix:rijSbox}).

The left-most byte is then XOR:ed with a value from the Rcon function 
depending on what round you are currently processing. You can read more 
about the Rcon function in section \ref{ch:Rcon}.

\subsection{Rijndael's S-Box}
Rijndael's S-box takes an input byte which it transforms according to a 
LUT (Figure \ref{matrix:rijSbox} in appendix \ref{app:matrix}). Where 
the most significant nibble is placed on the Y axis, and the least 
significant nibble is set on the X axis. Given the input \emph{0x31}, 
the output \emph{0xC7} would be received from the Rijndael's S-box.

\subsection{Rcon} \label{ch:Rcon}
The value input into the Rcon function depends on what round you are 
currently at. Which means that you would choose Rcon(1) for the first 
round, Rcon(2) for the second round, and so on. The values in the Rcon 
array are calculated mathematically, but might as well be accessed from 
a vector, such as the one found in Figure \ref{matrix:rcon} in 
appendix \ref{app:matrix}.

I illustrated the steps to be performed in the Rcon function, using a 
flowchart, which can be viewed in figure \ref{img:rcon} in appendix 
\ref{app:fig}.

If the input value is 0 or 1, the same value is returned, otherwise the 
following steps are performed \citep{RijndaelKeySchedule}. This can 
also be replaced by an S-box where you input your byte, and get another 
back, since the input byte is just used as a counter that decides how 
many times you perform steps \ref{item:step1} through \ref{item:step3} 

\Warning[TODO]{You need more reliable sources than WIKIPEDIA!}.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Set a variable c to 0x01.
\item If the input-value does not equal 1, set variable b to c \& 0x80. 
  Otherwise, go to \ref{item:exit_loop}. 
  \label{item:step1}
\item Left shift c one step.
\item If b is equal to 0x80 proceed to \ref{item:step2}, otherwise go to
  \ref{item:step3}.
\item Store the result of a bitwise XOR between c and 0x1B in c.
  \label{item:step2}
\item Decrease the input value by one, then go back to  
  \ref{item:step1}.
  \label{item:step3}
\item The output is set to c.
  \label{item:exit_loop}
\end{enumerate}
