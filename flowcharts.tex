\chapter{Flowcharts} \label{app:fig}
This appendix contains flowcharts that describe the extraction of the 
value from the rcon function, and how to perform a keyexpansion.
They are placed in this appendix instead of the thesis since they 
can be used for reference, but are not nescessary to understand how 
the results are obtained.
