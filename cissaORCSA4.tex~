\chapter{CISSA}
CISSA stands for \emph{Common IPTV Software-oriented Scrambling Algorithm} and 
is designed to be software-friendly. Opposite to the CSA3, CISSA is made to be 
easily descrambled in software, so that CPU-based systems such as computers and 
smart-phones can also implement it. In spite of being software-friendly, CISSA 
is possible to implement in hardware. \citep{DVB:2013}

But I've found absolutely no information on how CISSA is implemented, making it 
hard to analyze it, both in software-friendlyability as well as making an 
assessment as to whether it is possible to implement the scrambling part of it 
on an FPGA.

\section{Software friendly}
What makes this algorithm software friendly?
Is it still possible to make use of it on an FPGA - since FPGAs are so
general?
